2025 MCM Problem B: Managing Sustainable Tourism
2025 MCM 问题 B：管理可持续旅游
Juneau, Alaska, USA with a population of about 30,000 residents, set a record in 2023 with 1.6 million cruise passengers, hosting as many as seven large cruise ships on the busiest days, with upwards of around 20,000 visitors.[1] While these tourists bring in substantial revenue for the city, on the order of $375 million,[2] they also bring issues related to overcrowding that have the city working to limit the number of guests. Ironically, Mendenhall Glacier, one of the premier attractions in Juneau, has been receding, primarily due to warming temperatures caused, in part, by overtourism. The glacier has receded the equivalent of eight football fields since 2007, leading many locals to worry that the tourists and associated revenue will eventually disappear with the glacier.[3] Fortunately, Juneau has other attractions, including whale watching and rain forests, and can maintain their status as a tourist destination, provided they can develop and enact a plan for sustainable tourism.
阿拉斯加朱诺市人口约为30,000人，在2023年创下了接待160万邮轮游客的记录，在最繁忙的日子里，该市接待了多达七艘大型邮轮，游客数量高达约20,000人。虽然这些游客为该市带来了可观的收入，约为3.75亿美元，但也带来了过度拥挤的问题，促使该市努力限制游客数量。颇具讽刺意味的是，朱诺的主要景点之一门登霍尔冰川正在消退，主要原因之一是由于过度旅游导致的气温上升。自2007年以来，该冰川已经消退了相当于八个足球场的距离，许多当地居民担心，随着冰川的消失，游客和相关收入也将随之消失。幸运的是，朱诺还有其他景点，包括观鲸和雨林，只要能够制定并实施可持续旅游计划，该市仍可保持其旅游胜地的地位。
Recent reports[4] have highlighted the hidden costs of tourism and the growing need to account for and manage these costs to protect natural and cultural resources and build a sustainable tourism industry on which numerous communities around the world depend. These hidden costs include pressure on local infrastructure including drinking water supplies, waste management, and an overall increased carbon footprint in tourist destinations, many of which lie in environmentally sensitive regions. Local populations are also under pressure due to housing supplies and costs, overcrowding, and rowdy tourists. Various measures have been enacted to attempt to ease the burden, including increased hotel taxes, visitor fees, caps on the number of daily visitors, and restrictions on alcohol sales and consumption. Additional revenue from taxes have been used to support conservation, make improvements in infrastructure, and develop community programs. While many locals that depend on tourism are concerned that additional fees might drive tourists away and would rather see the numbers, and their businesses, grow, many other locals are becoming disgruntled and either leaving or protesting against tourists.
最近的报告强调了旅游的隐藏成本，以及为了保护自然资源和文化遗产并建立一个可持续的旅游产业而管理和核算这些成本的必要性，许多社区都依赖于这个产业。这些隐藏成本包括对当地基础设施（包括饮用水供应、废物管理和总体增加的碳足迹）的压力，许多旅游目的地都位于环境敏感地区。当地居民也因住房供应和成本、过度拥挤以及喧闹的游客而受到压力。为缓解这些压力，各地采取了多种措施，包括提高酒店税、收取游客费用、限制每日游客数量以及限制酒精销售和消费。增加的税收收入被用于支持保护工作、改善基础设施和发展社区项目。尽管许多依赖旅游业的当地居民担心额外的费用可能会赶走游客，他们更希望看到游客数量和他们的生意增长，但许多其他当地居民已经感到不满，要么离开，要么抗议游客。
• Build a model for a sustainable tourism industry in Juneau, Alaska. You may want to consider factors such as the number of visitors, overall revenue, and measures enacted to stabilize tourism. State clearly which factors you are optimizing, and which factors serve as constraints. Include a plan for expenditures from any additional revenue and show how these expenditures feed back into your model to promote sustainable tourism. Include a sensitivity analysis and discuss which factors are most important.
• 为阿拉斯加朱诺市建立一个可持续旅游产业的模型。您可以考虑游客数量、总收入以及为稳定旅游而采取的措施等因素。明确说明您正在优化哪些因素，哪些因素是约束条件。包括一个额外收入支出计划，并展示这些支出如何反馈到您的模型中以促进可持续旅游。包括敏感性分析，并讨论哪些因素最重要。
• Demonstrate how your model could be adapted to another tourist destination impacted by overtourism. How does the choice of location effect which measures will be most important? How might you use your model to promote attractions and/or locations that have fewer tourists to develop a better balance?
• 展示您的模型如何适应另一个受过度旅游影响的旅游目的地。地点的选择如何影响哪些措施最重要？您如何使用您的模型来推广游客较少的景点和/或地点，以实现更好的平衡？
• Write a one-page memo to the tourist council of Juneau outlining your predictions, the effects of various measures, and your advice on how to optimize outcomes.
• 写一份一页纸的备忘录给朱诺市旅游局，概述您的预测、各种措施的效果以及您关于如何优化结果的建议。
